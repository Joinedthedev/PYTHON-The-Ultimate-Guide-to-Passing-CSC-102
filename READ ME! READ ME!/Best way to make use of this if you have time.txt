Basically:
1.read all the notes in a nutshell
2. fortify that with a lil bit of the actual lecture notes and practice. 
3.Practice practice practice. Crack your head on the problems. All of them. Start from midterm and work your way up.

If I were you i'd give it a go before even looking at the answers. Work hard,and harder, and harder.

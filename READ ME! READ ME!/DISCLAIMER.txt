This study guide is catered towards COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS! That's not to say it wont work for the other departments
as well, but I thought I'd give a warning.

Also, this is not a gurantee pass(Although its like 85-90% imo), so if you still manage to fail after COMPREHENSIVELY
and EFFICIENTLY making use of this study guide: I'm sorry. Don't give up.

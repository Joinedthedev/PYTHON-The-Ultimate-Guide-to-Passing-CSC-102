"I often wonder why things end up the way they do. That's when I remember the situation we're in. It's been 2.5 years

that at this rate, we'll lose our homeland in less than 6 months. Nigeria is the only country willing to help, but God knows
they can't. Hell, they can't even help themselves. So this is the end huh?" - Salim B. 2064 World War IV An excerpt from "What Happened to the Nameless Country?"

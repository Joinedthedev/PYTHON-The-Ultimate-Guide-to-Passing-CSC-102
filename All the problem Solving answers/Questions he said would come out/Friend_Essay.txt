There are four main types of essays: narrative, descriptive, expository, and argumentative. Each has a unique purpose.
Some tell a story, some are descriptive, and others attempt to alter opinions.
One of the best ways to understand each type is to review a batch of essay examples.
Narration means youâ€™re telling a story from a certain viewpoint, and there is usually a reason for the telling. All
narrative essays have characters, setting, a climax, and most importantly, a plot.

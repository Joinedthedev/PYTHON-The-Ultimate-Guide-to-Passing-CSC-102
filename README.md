# The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Passing-CSC-102
I orignally created this back in 2020-2021 to help my classmates pass this course as a vast majority of them we're struggling.
I figured it could be useful to others who are currently taking the course now and in the future. 
And instead of sharing a file around why not a github link instead?
Anyway I hope you find this helpful. Please do read the various "READ ME's" as they apply to you.

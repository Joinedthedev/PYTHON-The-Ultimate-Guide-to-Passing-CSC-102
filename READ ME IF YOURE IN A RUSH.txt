The exam is probably tm. Not even tm, in a couple of hours. It's late, you're tired, you want to pass. In that case,
focus on:

1.QUESTIONS HE SAID WOULD COME OUT 
2.ALL THE NOTES IN A NUTSHELL
3.codes that follow the notes
4.CSC 1O2 FINALS 2020 ANSWERS: NO 2(most important) NO 7 & NO 8 & NO 6(Easiest) and obviously dont focus on the question alone
focus on how to do it.
